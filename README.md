# Craigslist Sniper Web App
A django web app for users to create and manage craigslist sniper notifications.

Its functionality is based on the code in the [craigslist-sniper repo](https://github.com/nediamond/craigslist-sniper).

It is about 95% functional (no user email validation system), but development stopped when I learned that its core functionality is against the Craigslist ToS.

This application should not be run because of that fact.
